# Hey Folks,üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
The project "Reliance Stock Market Prediction" is a notable achievement that focuses on predicting the stock prices of Reliance Industries Limited for the next 365 days. I developed this project during an internship, utilizing a variety of data analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data.
 # Description of The Project:
## Business Objective of the project
The main objective of the project is to predict the stock prices of Reliance Industries Limited for the upcoming 365 days. This involves obtaining essential stock data such as Open, High, Low, and Close prices from 2000 to 2022. The project aims to identify short-term and long-term trends, analyze the impact of external factors and significant events, and provide a forecast for the next month.  
# Description of The Data:
The project utilizes stock market DATA gathered from January 1, 2015, to February 28, 2023.
You can download the data from the above website or use the Yfinance library to collect the data.
## About Data üìà
### This data includes attributes such as:
#### Date: Date of trade
#### Open: Opening price of the stock
#### High: Highest price of the stock on that day
#### Low: Lowest price of the stock on that day
#### Close: Close price adjusted for splits
#### Adj Close: Adjusted close price adjusted for splits, dividends, and capital gain distributions
#### Volume: Volume of stock traded on that day
# Tools and Technologies:
## The project employs various tools and technologies, including:
#### Python programming language
#### Libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit
#### SVR, Random Forest, KNN, LSTM, and GRU models for stock price prediction
#### Deployment using Streamlit
## How to install these libraries?
### You can install these libraries by using the command.
#### You can install all the libraries in your system which I have used in my project by using only one command.
#### You will need Python in your system to use this command. You can use this given link to install Python in your system : Python
#### After installation of Python, you need to run this command in your command prompt.
